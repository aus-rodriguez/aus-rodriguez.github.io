            Music has always been a major part of my life. Since we were kids, my older brother and I were required to play an instrument. He really took off with it; he’s an extremely talented drummer and can cover for any instrument you’d find in your average rock band. I, on the other hand, never felt the passion that he had for instruments. Technically I can play drums, guitar, bass, piano, and alto saxophone, but anyone who actually plays those instruments (like my older brother) can tell that I’m an amateur. I have the vision, but I lack the physical talent and coordination needed to really excel. I always had fun with it though, and I took music classes all through high school. I was even in a high school band with my friends—we mostly played at school events. I started writing music in senior year of high school and since then it’s become one of my favorite hobbies. Honestly, I think my lack of physical talent is why I began writing music instead of playing it.

        <h3>The Beauty of Writing Music on Garageband</h3>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
            You see, writing music is about vision rather than execution. It’s a game of creativity and analysis, not dexterity. I don’t have to touch any instruments in order to create a song; I just need to figure out the rhythm and what notes each instrument plays. Once I know that, all I have to do is input the notes into Garageband and boomshakalaka, I’ve got a tune.
        </p>
        
        
        <h3>Where the Analysis Comes In</h3>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
            Being a mediocre musician, I often lack or have a hard time hearing the music inside of me. My inner ear isn’t good enough to compose songs out of the blue without some sort of structure. So that’s exactly what I give myself: a structure. It’s kind of like those old ad lib packets that you used to get as kids from your grandparents. The story is written already, and all you need are the details. 
        </p>
       
      
        <p class="post_paragraph">
            I make my structure by trying to imitate songs that I’m really vibing with that week or month. It’s a process of breaking down and recreating. I’m not good enough (and Garageband definitely isn’t good enough) to wholesale copy an artist’s music. Instead, I split a song into each of its instruments and try and capture the flow and feel of each part—the key is understanding the essence of each component and exactly why it’s there. Let’s take the song “Last Summer Whisper” by Anri. This is sort of how I analyzed it in my head:
        </p>
        <h3>An Example</h3>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
            Okay so the drums are laying a flat beat for the bass line. The bass drum plays on one and three unless it’s accenting the bass line in that measure. There’s no reverb on the bass which keeps it compact, but the snare has reverb that gives it the feel of playing in a room with a bit of echo. The snare almost always hits on beats two and four, so the drums are meant to be a stable foundation for the other parts. It keeps a consistent, basic beat. The hi-hat plays eighth notes, but it hits softer on the upbeats. That keeps it from taking focus away from the other parts as well as adding to the quiet, gentler vibe of the song. The hi-hat gets highlighted with a shaker during the chorus, again a softer sound than other complementary instruments like a cowbell.
        </p>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
            The synth they’re using sounds like an electric bell or xylophone, it gives the dreamy, wavy sound to the song. There’s a lot of dissonance and tension in the chords, so it probably means they’re playing in a minor scale. When they start a new section of the song the synth descends on the chord rather than starting each note simultaneously. That gives it the feel of falling into the beat, like a willow tree waving by a river at sunset. The chord progression tends to start low, jump high, then descend lower again before jumping back up, finally ending in a final drop into a tension-relieving major chord. The synth adds the ethereal quality to the song, like the song is breathing. It has waves and peaks that flow through you rather than strike you.
        </p>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
            The bass line both holds the beat with the drums and builds the funk on which the hook is built. It features downbeat-focused patterns that have syncopation in the second half of measures which flow in tandem with the synth. The synth is the lungs and the bass is the diaphragm; they’re both breathing together. It starts on the one and then goes up to build tension, dropping into a soft resolution followed by the highest, punchiest note to push the song into the next four measures. Once the main hook is in place, the bass is used to define the chord progression leading up to the chorus. It’s rhythm naturally leads the melody to a place where they can transition to the next phase. It’s subconscious, but your ear hears the bass and expects the hook to follow.
        </p>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
            The guitar riff at the beginning provides the first hook and funk which is later replaced with the vocals (the main hook). You can tell it’s the hook because it has the most movement of all the parts, playing a lot of eighth and sixteenth notes while the other instruments hold out chords. In the verse, it starts low, goes up, and comes back down slowly, like a left-tailed distribution. The eighth and sixteenth notes play in the ride up, while long and sustained notes bring the melody back down. The pre-chorus stands out with its flitting between two notes followed by a drop then another flitting. It descends step by step rather than smoothly. The chorus is similar to the verse, but it doesn’t resolve all of its tension until the very end; in fact, many of the sustained notes help build the tension in that section.
        </p>
        <h3>In Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
            I’m not sure if my thoughts articulated super clearly, but hopefully you can sort of understand how I break down a song into pieces. One thing that is key in this process is understanding WHY each instrument is part of the song, something more conceptual than knowing WHAT each instrument does. I consider the Why to be the most important facet of the analysis, but you can only answer that after you know What the instruments are doing. The What tells you the things you like in the song. It tells you why the song slaps and how important (or unimportant) each instrument is to the tune’s essence and vibe. But none of that is recreateable unless you know the Why. The Why enables the recomposition of the What into a new song. Going back to the ad lib metaphor, the Why is all the words surrounding the lines that you fill in. It is the heart of the structure: the key to understanding why you’re writing anything in the first place. The What is the little hint in parentheses under the blanks that give you an idea of what kind of words to write. It directs you to write something that is consistent with the Why. Great musicians have mastered both the What and the Why. The Why is the music that they hear in their heads, and they have the skill needed to translate the Why into the What. I aspire to be like that one day, but I currently lack the experience to internalize the Why and lack the dexterity to play the What. So instead I use analysis to dissect other’s work, borrowing their conceptual ideas and melodic templates for reassembly into my own original songs.
