        <h3>What Is the Meaning of Life?</h3>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
          Here’s my catchy hook/clickbait answer: there isn’t really one.
        </p>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
          I don’t believe that you were born on Earth in this exact moment of time specifically to do something, and I definitely don’t think it was predetermined by ‘fate’ or ‘God’ or ‘your strict parents who want you to become a doctor’. Well, in a sense I guess you could say it’s predetermined. I think that all time exists at the same time because of the existence of the fourth dimension (google Block Theory). Although we feel time as a condition of the moment, in reality it’s just another type of location. Everything that has happened and will happen exists simultaneously in the universe, we just can’t perceive it because we are three dimensional beings. So in a way everything you do has been predetermined, but not in the sense that someone has decided it for you. It’s just that all of your conscious, personal decisions that you will ever make already happened somewhere else in the universe. So that answers how I feel about predetermination (in that I believe in a version of it), but that’s off topic.
        </p>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
          I figured that if there was any intrinsic meaning in life, I could find it by drawing patterns in everything life has ever done ever since its creation hundreds of millions of years ago. I think looking at all of life’s history is important because people don’t often realize exactly how short our existence has been. The Earth is roughly 4500 million years old—4500 MILLION. Humans started (and I mean like the very first, more-primitive-than-cavemen humans) to show up about six million years ago. We are 0.1% of the Earth’s history, and the Earth has only been around for a third of the universe’s history. We are small and we are insignificant to the universe. That isn’t to say that we don’t matter; we matter to ourselves and that means everything. But that’s for another time, I’m getting off topic again.
        </p>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
          So, life has been around for about 3500 million years. It took a billion years after the Earth was created for life to show up. What has it done since then? What has it accomplished? Are there any similarities between the life forms of each epoch of the Earth’s history? Actually, there are. There are two things that life has done since the beginning of its existence: it has survived and it has reproduced. Those two actions are the only commonalities between every single version of life in our known universe: the only two things that life has been doing, without fail, since the very beginning. Given this, I would argue that, given no other inputs, the meaning of life is to survive and reproduce. It’s not that I’m confident in that answer; I just don’t believe it could feasibly be anything else, unless there isn’t a meaning to life. But who wants life with no meaning? That’s no fun, so let’s ground the inherent meaning of life in survival and reproduction.
        </p>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
          So we have our foundation, but where do we go from here? Is there more? Well, there is a caveat in my assertion that survival and reproduction are the only reasons we’re here; I said that they hold “given no other inputs.” Humans, in the short time we’ve existed, have in fact created other inputs. We’ve kind of mastered both survival and reproduction. We’ve reached the point where our only major threat is ourselves. Sure the sun will blow up eventually, or a meteor could hit Earth, but day-to-day the only thing putting humanity at risk is ourselves. But the main point is that with our advancement of technology, theoretically only a fraction of our total population should have to work in order to sustain humanity’s survival. So why does the rat race even exist?
        </p>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
          It exists because it gives value to us, it is something of our creation in order to make our time here feel meaningful. Basically what I’m arguing is that, once survival and reproduction are taken care of, it’s entirely up to you to decide why you’re here right now. I call it positive Nihilism: our lives have no meaning, and that is the most liberating condition of existence. It shouldn’t be depressing at all. Sure you can live for God or country or family, but those ideals are ones that you adopted yourself; no higher power ordained those goals as the ones that humans are born to work towards.
        </p>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
          Again, there is an asterisk on total freedom because there still are the two intrinsic purposes of our existence. Although we have risen above them, we cannot forget them. And we haven’t; you can see how survival and reproduction have influenced the way we have evolved. For instance, look at our morals as a species. Murder is almost always a bad thing because it goes directly against survival. In older times contraception was considered evil because it contradicted reproduction. But stealing bread to feed your family (Les Mis anyone?) is a grey area because, although private property has allowed for the expansion of civilization, the actual action itself is meant to further survival. This pursuit to protect and advance the two primal actions is ingrained in our biology. You don’t have a family so that you can work; you work so that you can have a family. So that’s my addendum to positive Nihilism: you can create any meaning you want in life, but it should never go directly against the two actions that constitute life’s inherent meaning.
        </p>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
          Of course that means basically nothing because of how vague it is. You could argue that protection of all life is paramount and use that to justify killing humans. You could argue that you yourself are a burden on everyone else and that your death is a benefit to society. You could argue that a lot of things in the world are zero-sum; if I get something then you can’t get that thing, meaning that advancing my survival will often actively work against yours. In other words, there’s a lot of wiggle room to define your own life’s meaning while staying true to your inherent purposes.
        </p>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
          So in summary: my life is my own to determine, and the things that give me value do so because I say they do, not because of anyone else or any higher power.
