        <h2 class="post_title">Writing Fiction and Poetry</h2>
        <h3 class="post_subtitle">Two Word: Observation and Articulation</h3>
        <h3>Writing's Place in my Childhood</h3>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
          When I was little, I always thought that I was going to become some sort of author/historian. I used to read tons of books—I was pretty much that short asian kid wearing crocs and holding a book that you see at a store every once in a while. I won my middle school spelling bee though, and I always scored in the 99th percentile on reading/English sections on standardized tests, so reading definitely had some positive effects on me. One major thing it did was give me a passion for writing. I was writing stories by first grade, and in fifth grade I took my first creative writing class at a summer camp. In eighth grade, I started tutoring with author/poet Sarah Cortez, and over the next three years she taught me pretty much everything I know about writing fiction and poetry. Since then I’ve taken a few other writing classes, the most recent one being a college creative writing course. They helped me keep Ms. Cortez’s lessons ingrained in my head and allowed me to practice and share my work.

        <p class="post_paragraph">
          I learned a lot from Ms. Cortez. The older I get, the more I see how she evolved the processes that I use to interpret the world around me. Her writing lessons have started to apply to everything I see; it changed the way that I think and the way that I speak. A lot of it has to do with attention to detail.

        <h3>The Essense of Writing and Fiction Writing</h3>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
          Everyone has an imagination, but imagination exists as raw, pure thought. Raw thoughts are unintelligible, so they have to be expressed in a different medium to be understood. That’s where language comes into play. Writing is just a recorded form of thinking. Words are the common currency that humans use to trade thoughts. Journals and diaries are probably the most basic form of this; they summarize memories and feelings from your brain on paper. They express real things that you have experienced, so they’re often the easiest things for you to write about. It’s just written thought. As you start to tread into fiction genres, though, writing starts to take a new shape; it becomes the embodiment of imagination. It’s the literal, tangible form of human imagination. That is where I aspire to be as a writer. I want to be able to create clear, physical manifestations of my own imagination.

        <h3>What are Observation and Articulation?</h3>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
          What sets good books apart from the rest is the clarity of the thoughts that the author is trying to communicate. The more consistent and continuous their fictional worlds are, the more real it feels and the deeper the readers are drawn into it. The realness of a story comes from the author’s ability to articulate, to be able to find the right words to describe the images in their head. The crazy thing is, no book can actually describe an entire scene in detail; there’s just not enough room on the page to capture every single thing that you experience in one space. So, similar to doodling, you have to pick exactly which details build the perfect framework for the reader to imagine the world. The reader isn’t actually looking directly into an author’s imagination; rather, the author is creating a guide book for the reader’s own imagination to fill in, like a coloring book or a children’s menu at a family-friendly Italian restaurant. Since we are all human, there are certain universal experiences and feelings that we have. Although we all approach these things differently, at our core they mostly affect us in the same way. Author’s tap into these relatable feelings and create new events centered around those sentiments. Even though the reader may not have any experience with the actual action going on in the scene, they can still be hooked due to the empathy they feel for the characters involved and their emotional reactions to key events. Articulation is the author’s ability to manufacture the frameworks that stimulate a reader’s imagination through a concise mix of physical details and emotional pulls.

        <p class="post_paragraph">
          Observation is the conscious effort we make to take note of our surroundings. It’s a process of gathering information to use later on. It is the basis of our social learning; from a young age we teach ourselves how to behave by observing and imitating the actions of those around us. For a writer, the key to observation is expanding the lessons to be learned from the things we see. It’s not just an example of how we should act; it’s a template for how the world works and what emotions can be evoked through certain physical details. Think about a tiny red stain on a white T shirt. If you were to meet someone wearing that shirt, the stain would likely affect your impression of the person more than the shirt itself. A shirt is common, so it doesn’t give you that much information about who the character is. The meat lies in the details that make someone different than (or similar to) you. Those details are the ones that writers hone in on and recreate in their work. It’s those crucial details that draw the shapes which are colored in by the reader's imagination.

        <h3>Applying Writing Skills to Life</h3>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
          Similar to my experiences with making music, I was not born with an extensive library of observations to use in my writing. Instead, I have had to look closely at the world around me to find the small, communicative details that expand and evoke emotions about the settings I create. Articulation is paramount in hooking a reader and pulling them into the depths of your imagination, but you can only reach that level of articulation through careful observation of your world, your life, and your emotions. Understanding the feelings you have and the things which created those feelings inside of you helps you recreate those experiences for your readers. Observation leads to articulation. It’s like what I said about the What and the Why in regards to music composition. It isn’t enough to note the details of the things you see; you have to be able to tie those details to the underlying emotions and thoughts surrounding them. ‘Why’ is the most important question to answer, but it relies on an understanding of What is going on. In my experience, writing has been a practice in constant observation as well as a practice in articulating the thoughts and feelings I have about those observations. This skill applies to all facets of life. For instance, in accounting, my understanding of how healthy a company is relies on my ability to spot anomalies in their financial statements, followed by my ability to build a story from those details. Practicing observation and articulation has helped my core personality grow as well. Learning how to speak for my characters has enhanced my ability to speak for myself, and I look more deeply into the emotions that I feel and try harder to articulate why I am the way that I am. It’s imperfect and riddled with biases, but it gives me a frame of reference on how to respond to future events. I understand myself better, and because of that I can understand others better and how we all fit into this world that we share.

          Here's a piece of flash fiction I wrote a few years ago. It's not amazing, but hopefully it'll give you the idea of what it means to focus on key details to tell a larger story: <h3><a href="AWITP.pdf" class="link">A Walk in the Park</a></h3>
