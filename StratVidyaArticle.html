        <h3>Growing up with Age of Empires</h3>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
          Yes, the home page picture is me playing Age of Empires 2 on a dinosaur computer. I think it’s from 2003-2004, so I was somewhere between four and five. Age of Empires 2 was the first videogame that I played, even before Pokemon or Mario Kart. I loved history as a kid, and being an American boy what that really meant is that I loved military history. I still do, but I don’t watch as many tv shows about it now; I guess that’s partly because the history channel went to shit. So anyways, Age of Empires was the greatest thing little me could’ve imagined. It’s a whole world where I get to build armies and castles and attack other armies and castles.

        <h3>Deathmatch and Supremacy: Connecting Videogames to the Real World</h3>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
          I started playing just for the pure world-building aspect, the aesthetic of the buildings and units and environments. I was four, so it’s not like I hit the ground running. Everything new was cool to me back then. Eventually though, I started to play for the objective. I played this mode called Deathmatch, and in that game mode they give you tons of resources to help players focus on fighting. I started figuring out basic strategies, and they were often things I learned from real battles. From the battle of Cannae I learned how to flank an enemy. From Trafalgar I learned how to utilize mobility and versatility to outmaneuver larger enemies. From Alesia I learned how to divide and conquer. From Hastings I learned the power of cavalry and the high ground. I started figuring out the counters to each type of unit, how to place each castle to be the most advantageous, how to siege, and how to attack swiftly and precisely.
        </p>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
          Deathmatch kept me entertained for years, but again I eventually got a bit bored and decided to switch game modes to Supremacy. In Supremacy you start at the lowest age with sparse resources, so half of your gameplay becomes dedicated to your kingdom’s economy. Protection of villagers and non-renewable resources takes the limelight, and the level of strategy required increases significantly. How do you want to divide your laborers to gather resources? At what point do you divert resources from growth to build a military? Since you start at the lowest age, you have to consider which unit upgrades are worth your time or not. You don’t have the resources to make every type of unit, so you have to specialize. Rather than just being a game in military strategy, the matches turn into exercises in cost analysis. Which upgrades have a positive Net Present Value? What non-imitable competitive advantages does my civilization have? How effectively does each unit need to fight to be worth the cost? Can I get more use from weaker, cheaper units if I micromanage their attack? In a lot of ways, Age of Empires is the weaponization of the things I learned in my managerial accounting class. There’s investments with varying risk and reward, and your success hinges on your efficiency in both obtaining and using resources.
      </p>
      <p class="post_paragraph">
        The most challenging part of Age of Empires, however, is the time pressure. If you take the time to think through all of your options, you may lose solely because your enemy beat you to the punch. Unlike some other major Real Time Strategy (RTS) games like Civ, Age of Empires is not turn based. You and your enemy move simultaneously, meaning that much of your efficiency depends on your ability to multitask. And as your kingdom’s population nears two hundred, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep everyone busy. Idle resources are wasted resources as units and upgrades now are worth more than units and upgrades later. In essence, the Time Value of Money principle applies to your economy, and the first mover advantage influences your military strategy.

    <h3>How Videogames Help Kids Like Me</h3>
    <p class="post_paragraph">
      All of that is to say that I disagree with people who argue that videogames don’t teach children anything. I learned more from Age of Empires about analysis and project management than anything I was doing in school as an eight year old. I will concede that not every videogame is like this, though. As much as I enjoy Modern Warfare, it’s a game that really just relies on your reaction speed and ability to memorize maps. But RTS games are different. I was learning how to pursue one objective through two complementary and simultaneous avenues of attack. It taught me how to quickly scan an area to see exactly which places require my resources, and which require my time and focus. Playing with my dad promoted effective communication and preparation, practicing division of responsibilities and teamwork. And all this is separate from the factual information I learned through playing the game. In addition to learning much about the history and culture of old civilizations, Age of Empires taught me a plethora of vocabulary: masonry, conscription, guilds, heresy, fervor, theocracy, arson, fletching, ballistics, husbandry, loom, etc. You know, all words that helped me sound like a total nerd at nine years old, but that’s besides the point. What I’m really trying to say is that there are deep connections between a person’s hobbies and their career. Skills that you practice are exactly that: skills. They aren’t contained to the activity in which you learned it; you secretly use them in all areas of your life. In other words, my potential as an employee isn’t solely defined by my internships.
